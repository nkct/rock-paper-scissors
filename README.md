# rock-paper-scissors
Its only slightly rigged.

This is a simple rock-paper-scissors game made in Python.
The player can input text commands and the enemy's choice is entirely random.
It works fairly well but its nothing fancy.

If you want to play it just run the RockPaperScissors.exe executable.
Its not a virus, I promise.
But open it at your own risk.
